Title: NLS Models for Photosynthetic Light Response 
Version: 0.1.0
Depends: R (>= 2.10), tidyr(>= 1.3.1)
Description: This package was made for researchers to 1) easily construct light 
    response curves, 2) compare different photosynthetic models with their data, 
    and 3) extract photosynthetic traits from light response curves. The package 
    allows users to test their data with mechanistic and empirical models like 
    the rectangular hyperbola Michaelis-Menton based models
    ((eq1 (Baly (1935) <DOI 10.1098/rspb.1935.0026>))
    (eq2 (Kaipiainenn (2009) <DOI 10.1134/S1021443709040025>))
    (eq3 (Smith (1936) <DOI 10.1073/pnas.22.8.504>))), hyperbolic tangent based 
    models ((eq4 (Jassby & Platt (1976) <DOI 10.4319/LO.1976.21.4.0540>))
    (eq5 (Abe et al. (2009) <DOI 10.1111/j.1095-921X.2009.00253.x>))), 
    the non-rectangular hyperbola model (eq6 (Prioul & Chartier (1977) 
    <DOI 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a085354>)), exponential based models 
    ((eq8 (Webb et al. (1974) <DOI 10.1007/BF00345747>)), (eq9 
    (Prado & de Moraes (1997) <DOI 10.1007/BF02982542>))), and finally the 
    Ye model (eq11 (Ye (2007) <DOI 10.1007/s11099-007-0110-5>)). The capacity 
    for each of these nonlinear least squares models to express photosynthetic 
    response under changing light conditions has been well described and 
    supported in the literature but distinctions in each mathematical model 
    represent moderately different assumptions about physiology and trait 
    relationships which will ultimately produce different calculated functional 
    trait values. These models were all thoughtfully discussed and curated by 
    Lobo et al. (2013) <DOI 10.1007/s11099-013-0045-y> to express the importance
    of selecting an appropriate model for analysis. Each model can be easily 
    tested and compared with this package to ensure accurate evaluations of 
    light response, which is particularly useful in systems without an 
    established photosynthetic model. 
    To establish a model of best fit, this package includes functions to rapidly 
    test your data with each model equation, a function to efficiently store all 
    results in an array, and a plotting function to visualize differences in how 
    each model represents the photosynthetic light response. 
    Methods were established in Davis et al. (2024) <DOI ???????> 
    to evaluate the impact of analytical choice in a phylogenetic analysis of 
    the function-valued trait, and the gas exchange data on 28 sunflower species 
    from that study are included as a play data set here.
