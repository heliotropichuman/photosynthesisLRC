This package is intended for users to easily test their light response curve data with different photosynthetic models and return photosynthetic functional traits for their measured observations from calculated model parameters. 

# Instructions 
The data set must include a column labelled "SampleID" for each samples unique identifier, a column labeled "A" for the measured assimilation rates, and "PARi" for the measured light intensities recorded.
