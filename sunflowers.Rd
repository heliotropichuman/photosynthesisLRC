\description{
This dataset contains photosynthetic light response curves for
    28 sunflower species in the genus *Helianthus*. The data was gathered in
    a common garden to evaluate phylogenetic change to photosynthetic
    response across as a function-valued trait (Davis et al. 2024).
}
\details{
All plants were grown in fertilized 1 gallon pots during August-
    December 2019 at the University of Central Florida's Transgenic
    Greenhouse. Measurements were taken for two hours before and after solar
    noon with the Portable Photosynthetic Systems (PPS) TARGAS-1 on the most
    recently expanded full leaf during the juvenile stage just before
    flowering (V4-6) (NDSU Stages of Sunflower Development).  The TARGAS-1
    portable leaf cuvette (PLC) was clamped on the leaf perpendicular to the
    leaf margin, and photosynthetic measurements were taken at approximately
    420 ppm CO2, ambient humidity, and 500 ppm flow. Photosynthetic responses
    were recorded at 9 levels with an acclimation of 2-5 minutes at PARi 0,
    PARi 50, PARi 100, PARi 250, PARi 500, PARi 1000, PARi 2000,
    PARi 2500 (µmol s/m2). The data was manually curated such that duplicate
    instantaneous assimilation points were removed and only one single
    representative sample from each replicate was used in analysis. The data
    set includes the Sample name, the species name, the replicate number,
    and 19 other variables obtained from the TARGAS-1 measurement.
