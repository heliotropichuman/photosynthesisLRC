\usage{
```R
    ploteq(
        eqX = eq1
        eq_name = "eq1"
        i,
        data,
        title = "_",
        species_subset = NULL)
 ```
}
\arguments{
\item{eqX}{A function representing the photosynthetic light response equation
(e.g., \code{eq1}, \code{eq2}).}

\item{eq_name}{A character string representing the name of the equation,
to be included in the plot title.}

\item{i}{An integer specifying the index of the species in the \code{inds}
vector.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the experimental data with at least two
columns: 'PARi' for the incident light and 'A' for the measured
photosynthetic rate.}

\item{title}{An optional character string specifying the title of the plot
(defaults to title in the format "i SampleID Equation X.}

\item{species_subset}{An optional vector of species names from \code{inds}
to be plotted. If \code{NULL}, all species in \code{inds} will be used
(default is \code{NULL}).}
}
\value{
A plot of the measured data points for the selected species (open
    points), with curve parameters from the fitted equation (black points),
    the NLS curve (red line), and the model fit (dashed blue line). It will
    also return the reconstructed model fit as a list.
}
\description{
This function plots the fit of a given photosynthetic light
    response equation for all or select species in a data set. This base R
    plot includes the SampleID and the equation number in the title.
}
\details{
This function takes the equation of photosynthetic light response
    models and fits it to the data for a given species. It then plots the
    observed and predicted values, highlighting specific points on the curve
    (such as the model curve paramaters \code{I15}, \code{I25}, \code{I85},
    and \code{I95}), where the number (X) is the carbon assimilation rate at
    X percent of the maximum assimilation in the measured data. The equation
    name is included in the plot title, and an optional subset of
    species can be selected for plotting. The function also calculates
    various fit statistics and adds both the original and reconstructed
    predictions as curves to the plot.
